# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I created this webpage to help new bootcamp students, like me, learn and improve at coding fundamentals. HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript all have a lot of information pertaining to how they work, and having notes easily accessible can be a huge help, so that is why I created this webpage.
